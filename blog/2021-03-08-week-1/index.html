This will be an API server with all the logic.</p><p>For authentication I chose <a href=https://jwt.io/>JSON web tokens</a>, which I never really worked with but wanted to for a long time. Of course everything took longer than expected until I got my first user sessions going. Luckily I found this (blog post by Yulia Oletskaya)[https://blog.usejournal.com/rails-api-jwt-auth-vuejs-spa-eb4cf740a3ae] that even came with tests. Nice.</p><p>Btw, I installed <a href=https://insomnia.rest/>Insomnia</a> as an open source alternative to Postman for testing endpoints. (Well, the client is open source, their paid hosted services are not) It&rsquo;s pretty nice, would recommend.</p><p>Yulia uses the <a href=https://github.com/tuwukee/jwt_sessions>jwt_sessions gem</a> which keeps track of tokens with the help of Redis, so I setup Redis, too. That might be useful for caching and other stuff in the future, too.</p><p>I set up CI with GitHub Actions, which was smoother than expected. In the past I&rsquo;d use Travis CI for most CI needs, but that&rsquo;s no longer an option for me.
After that I installed <a href=https://rubocop.org/>Rubocop</a> for linting (I get very sloppy if there are no checks in place, and the initial fixing I already had to do was quite surprising&mldr;) and added it as a step in CI as well. Boom!
Integration with <a href=https://coveralls.io>Coveralls</a> for code coverage and <a href=https://sentry.io>Sentry</a> for exception tracking are still on my list though.</p><p>While automating things I decided to setup up CD to a staging environment on a hobby dyno on Heroku as well. I want the production app to be deployed on a VPS via docker (-compose) but it will take some time until that is all done and available. So, why not have an always up-to-date version running for easy testing and have an alternative way to deploying? Exactly!</p><p>For documentation and a developer blog I set up this page, using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> as static site generator and the <a href=https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-whisper-theme>Hugo Whisper Theme</a> and made some adjustments. Github Actions also helps here with automatic deployment to GiHub Pages.</p><p>Too much GitHub? Maybe, but it definitely helps getting setup quickly. I&rsquo;m more familiar with the interface than with GitLab&rsquo;s plus I don&rsquo;t want the hassle to maintain (and pay for!) my own infrastructure at this point.</p><h2 id=what-am-i-doing-right-now>What am I doing right now?</h2><p>Now that the baseline automation is in place, let&rsquo;s get coding!</p><p>Database-wise I want to work through the baseline user management, app and environment settings and ideally start the modeling of cases. The last part is quite interesting so I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a dedicated post just on this.</p><p>Coming Friday I&rsquo;ll also meet with the Feminizidmap team for a first walkthrough and round of user stories. I&rsquo;ll expect a lot of input and tickets for the frontend and I hope to have enough backend in place to quickly push out a first version ðŸ¤ž.</p><h2 id=motivations--challenges>Motivations & challenges</h2><p>I&rsquo;m super motivated just by finally starting to work on this full time! I collected a lot of notes with ideas from the past two-ish (three-ish??) years I&rsquo;m involved with the project and I really hope this tool can make the work in the team easier and push the public discourse further.</p><p>In the project we also see more and more inquiries for femi(ni)cide data, from violence-against-women activists, researchers and theater performance creators. It&rsquo;s definitely a topic that is on people&rsquo;s minds these days.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=sub-footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/feminizidmap rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Project repositories</a></li><li><a href=https://feminizidmap.org>Main project site</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6"><a href=https://www.bmbf.de/ rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target=_blank><img src=/assets/bmbf-logo.svg alt=BMBF></a>
