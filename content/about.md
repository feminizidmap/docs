[Feminizidmap.org](https://feminizidmap.org/) is a **research project on femi(ni)cides in Germany**. See the main website for [definitions of femi(ni)cide](https://feminizidmap.org/about/) and [methodology](https://feminizidmap.org/faq/).

Tech.Feminizidmap.org, this project, is a **software research project** with the goal of developing tools to support the volunteers and the process of documentation cases of femi(ni)cides. The project is part of the 9th funding round of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/projects/round-9/).

As part of this we will build a [data entry interface](/docs/mapper) with user management and review process and that allows the publishing of data through an API.

We will use this API directly in two web applications: an interactive, map-based, report-style visualization of the data and a customizable export-to-csv interface to make the data available to people without programming knowledge.

You can find a list of the project's components on the [documentation overview](/docs) or their source code (all published under open source licenses) directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/feminizidmap).
